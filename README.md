# Movie data visualization 
Use data to make suggestions for a movie-making company.<br>
This is the third project for Udacity Business Analyst Courses.

## Original data:
Present in Excel and showing revenue, cast, direstor, keywords, genres and so forth of 10844 films. 

## Overview:
I cleaned wrong or missing data in Excel and then used Tableau to visualize these data in order to explore questions like: What is the difference between the film level and the box office shot by different directors? How does a movie based on a novel behave compared to a non-fiction adapted movie? (several questions like that). Finally, based on these analysis results, I made suggestions to a newly established film company about how to make the first movie (like who to choose as a director, which genre the film is).

## Findings

### How has the genre changed over time?


After 1990, film genres became more and more diversified, but in recent years there has been a tendency to concentrate on a few popular genres. We can look at the number of different genres and the box office over time. It can be seen that in recent years, action, crime and some other types of films are popular options, and the box office performance is attracting.

### Comparision between Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures


The two studios each have a preference for the type of film they choose, and it's not all about profit. Generally, Paramount Pictures invested more in the film's budget than Universal Pictures and made better profits at the box office.

### How do movies based on fiction performed compared to non-fiction adaptations?


Generally, the films based on the novels had higher budgets, but also having higher box office receipts and higher net profits. In the mean time, they earned more concentrated ratings and more positive praises. There is no clear correlation between movie ratings and box office sales, though movies with high ticket sales tended to score higher.

### Comparison between different directors 

So far we have learned about the choice of film styles, whether to consider adapting novels, and have learned from excellent film companies. The next step is to learn about directors to determine which directors to choose for our films. By screening out the top 10 directors with the highest average net earnings for single-director films, we can see that their success comes not only from the choice of style, but mainly from the quality of the films. Depending on the quality of the film, we can invite J.J.Abrams and David Yates to be the director of our movie.
