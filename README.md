Use data to make suggestions for a movie-making company
##Original data:
Present in Excel and showing revenue, cast, direstor, keywords, genres and so forth of 10844 films. 
##Work:
I cleaned wrong or missing data in Excel and then used Tableau to visualize these data in order to explore questions like: What is the difference between the film level and the box office shot by different directors? How does a movie based on a novel behave compared to a non-fiction adapted movie? (several questions like that). Finally, based on these analysis results, I made suggestions to a newly established film company about how to make the first movie (like who to choose as a director, which genre the film is).
